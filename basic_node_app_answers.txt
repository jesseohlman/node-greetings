1. It is a function that can be exported from one file, imported into another file,
 and be called like if it was in its original file.

2. module.exports is a way to export modules independently or in object form, but it is also
 a variable that can be over written. Exports functions the same as module.exports,
 however, asigning exports to a value will not effect module.exports.

3. using exports over moduleexports is recommended because you can overwrite exports without
causing problems with other exports.
